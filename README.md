`Pushpath` in its simplest form is like a self-service Paas(Platform as a Service) build tool via web interface.
Using an existing technologies eg. Docker.io, Vagrant, Puppet, Virtualbox, or VMWare - they'll be glued together to form a platform that suits your needs.
Such platform could be a [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29), [LYME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LYME_%28software_bundle%29) or [MEAN](http://mean.io/)

For people/someone who are interested into  [Continuous Delivery (CD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) but doesn't have the time to spin their head around for a start in then this might be a good jumpstart.

### Goals

* Provision lightweight virtual machines w/ tools for CD or CI
* Build virtual machines for LAMP, LYME or MEAN stack

### Current Status

The project is still in early development stages. Iâ€™ve only been working on it for about 3 weeks as of this writing (9/Jan/2014)
